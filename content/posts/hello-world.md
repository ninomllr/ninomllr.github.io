This is my personal blog project to write down some of my learnings and projects around [categories/dataengineering](#dataengineering) [categories/softwaredevelopment](#softwaredevelopment) [categories/dataengineering](#mlops) [categories/opensource](#opensource) [categories/elt](#elt) [categories/dwh](#dwh) and many more data and software topics. Not sure what else I will blog about, let's see.
